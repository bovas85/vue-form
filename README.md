## Summary of test

For this code challenge, I will create a form component that fills a Vuex store, which is then displayed in a Summary component.

## Requirements

1. Initialise VueJS in an online editor (JSFiddle or CodePen)
2. Create Store / State Management (VueX)
3. Use of a UI framework is optional.
4. Create a summary component which displays form entries from the Store
5. Create a form component (this form should be controlled by an ‘Add’ button and
disappear after successful form submission)
6. On submit, validate the form
7. If the form submits successfully set all the details in the Store
8. Ensure the summary component is updated
9. Provide a live link to share

## Tech Stack

This project was bootstrapped with [Vue-cli 3](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli).

You can find the most recent version of their docs [here](https://cli.vuejs.org/).

## Installation
This project is live on CodeSandBox but you can also download the repository at https://github.com/bovas85/vue-form and follow below to deploy:
- Change directory into the directory of the project and install the node modules with

  `npm i` or `yarn`

- To run the project locally with type:

  `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`

  The dev webpage will open automatically or otherwise can be found at `localhost:3000`

- To build for production type:

  `npm run build` or `yarn build`

  You will then be able to deploy it using `now` or `netlify` or a custom node server.

## The Process

## Sketching the app

I always try to visualize where the components will be in the Design, and make sure they make sense for the app and logic.

## App Skeleton

I always have a starter template which I created and updated every time I found some new and better ways to do things in code.

It contains improvements, performance tweaks and several components that I might need.

In this case I used some of those improvements (ie. `.env` file for styles alias) that I found.

## Refining

Once that's in place, I make sure I only keep what's really needed and try to scrap the rest (console logs, useless comments and TODOs that I have completed).

It won't be compiled, but it would pollute the repository.

## Git init

From here on, you can see the commits in the repo I will share via e-mail (or pull request).
